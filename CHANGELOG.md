## Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **PostGIS for Geolocation**: Chose PostGIS over simple lat/lng columns for:
   - Accurate distance calculations
   - Complex polygon boundary checks
   - Built-in spatial indexing (GiST)
   - Industry-standard geography types

2. **JSONB for Integrity Verdict**: Flexible structure allows:
   - Different verification methods without schema changes
   - Easy addition of new verification checks
   - Efficient querying with GIN indexes
   - Backward compatibility

3. **Materialized Views**: Pre-computed aggregations for:
   - Fast reporting queries
   - Reduced load on main tables
   - Scheduled refresh during off-peak hours
   - Concurrent refresh support

4. **Zero-downtime Migration Pattern**: Expand/backfill/contract ensures:
   - No application downtime
   - Safe rollback procedures
   - Gradual code migration
   - Production stability

5. **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail provides:
   - Compliance with data regulations
   - Security monitoring
   - Change history tracking
   - Debugging capabilities

### Future Considerations

- Consider partitioning `attendance` table by month for better performance at scale
- Evaluate need for read replicas as traffic grows
- Monitor materialized view refresh times and adjust schedules
- Consider archiving old audit logs to separate table
- Evaluate caching strategy for frequently-accessed policies
